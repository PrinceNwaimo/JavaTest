Concept Recap â€” Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm

Goal: Find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in a weighted, undirected graph.

Idea:

Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of weight.

Initialize an empty tree T.

Add edges one by one:

For each edge (u, v):

If adding (u, v) does not form a cycle (i.e., u and v are in different sets),
add it to the MST.

Stop when MST contains (V - 1) edges.

Key data structure:
ðŸ‘‰ Unionâ€“Find (Disjoint Set Union) â€” used to efficiently check and merge connected components.
