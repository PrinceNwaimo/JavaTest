//How it works:
//
//1. Base case: Recursion stops when n == 1, indicating the array portion is sorted.
//2. One pass: Performs a bubble sort pass, bubbling the largest unsorted element to the end.
//3. Recursive call: Calls itself with n-1, effectively fixing the largest element's position and reducing problem size.
//
//Characteristics:
//
//- Recursive approach: Uses function calls to manage sorting iterations.
//- Time complexity: O(n^2) like iterative Bubble Sort; not efficient for large datasets.
//- Space complexity: O(n) due to recursive call stack.
//
//Considerations:
//
//- Not tail-recursive: Might lead to stack overflow for very large arrays if not optimized by compiler/JVM.
//- Educational value: Demonstrates recursion application to sorting.
//- Practicality: Generally outperformed by other sorting algorithms; not typically used in production.
//
//Recursive Bubble Sort illustrates applying recursion to a sorting problem but shares Bubble Sort's inherent inefficiencies, making it less suitable for real-world large-scale sortingÂ tasks//
