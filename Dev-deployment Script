 Here's a basic deployment script for deploying your Spring Boot application to a development environment. This script assumes that you have Docker installed on your dev environment server and that your application is containerized using Docker.
Dockerfile for the Spring Boot application:
Make sure you have a Dockerfile that builds your Spring Boot application. Here's an example:
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
VOLUME /tmp
COPY target/your-app.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","/app.jar"]

Docker Compose file (optional):
If your application depends on other services like a PostgreSQL database, you can use Docker Compose to manage these services. Here's an example docker-compose.yml:
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/your-app:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
      - DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://your-db-host:5432/your-db-name
      - DATABASE_USERNAME=your-db-username
      - DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-db-password
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: your-db-name
      POSTGRES_USER: your-db-username
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your-db-password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  postgres-data:
Deployment script:
Here is a deployment script that will build the Docker image, push it to Docker Hub (or another registry), and then deploy it using Docker Compose. Save this as deploy.sh:
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
APP_NAME="your-app"
DOCKER_USERNAME="your-dockerhub-username"
VERSION="latest"

# Build the Docker image
echo "Building the Docker image..."
mvn clean package -DskipTests
docker build -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/$APP_NAME:$VERSION .

# Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
echo "Pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub..."
docker push $DOCKER_USERNAME/$APP_NAME:$VERSION

# SSH into the server and deploy the Docker image
echo "Deploying the Docker image to the server..."
ssh your-username@your-server-ip << EOF
  docker pull $DOCKER_USERNAME/$APP_NAME:$VERSION
  docker-compose down
  docker-compose up -d
EOF

echo "Deployment complete!"

Make the script executable:
Ensure the deploy.sh script is executable by running:
chmod +x deploy.sh
Run the deployment script:
Execute the deployment script:
./deploy.sh

Explanation
Dockerfile: Defines how to build the Docker image for your Spring Boot application.
docker-compose.yml: Defines the services needed for your application, including the app and a PostgreSQL database.
deploy.sh: A script to build, push, and deploy the Docker image. It assumes you are using Maven to build your Spring Boot application and Docker Compose to manage your containers.
Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose: Installed on your development environment.
SSH access: To your development server.
Maven: For building the Spring Boot application.
Docker Hub account: Or another Docker image registry.
